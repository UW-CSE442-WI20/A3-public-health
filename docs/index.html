Focus put on how Chlamydia, Human immunodeficiency virus, Campylobacteriosis, Salmonellosis, Shigellosis, Invasive pneumococcal disease, and Pertussis compare to one another in any given month. Presenting individual months as "snapshots" in time.

We chose to do a bar graph, to illustrate that even though they are all common diseases but some are more prevalent at a given month of the year. We created a slider for users to select what month of the year they want to look, and if the users want to know the trend they can slide the sliders to see an animated bar chart. For people who emphasize more on the present, they are really only interested in what diseases are more prevalent this month and they can use the slider the month they are interested in. <br> <strong>What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?</strong><br> We considered pie charts. For each disease we made a pie chart breaking down by gender and race per year. We also looked at a population pyramid-like design but with infection rate instead of population. We also considered a line graph showing infection rate trends. We want something that is easy to interpret and interactive, so we go with an interactive bar chart design. The bar chart clearly shows which disease is most dangerous at which time. Also, an animated bar graph has a stronger visual impact and can leave a stronger impression than a traditional static line graph. Also, using a bar chart is more scalable and accessible than a line graph, because identifying the top 10 most common diseases in a given period from a bar chart of 50 diseases is easier than that of a line graph of 50 diseases. When there are 50 lines on a line graph, it is too crowded and users need to rely on color and shape combinations to distinguish diseases that are not friendly to people with difficulties identifying colors. In our data, Chlamydia is significantly larger than the other diseases, so we need a log scale to display the disease counts for users to be able to interpret the differences. <br> <strong>An overview of your development process.</strong><br> We started with finding data and data cleaning. Then we move on to deciding which visualization we should use. After that, we created images of the final deliverable, which guided our implementation process. Lastly, we began implementing the final deliverable. <br> <strong>Describe how the work was split among the team members.</strong><br> All of us searched for data and discussed which one to use. Anthony led the data cleaning process. Deciding on the visualization to use was also a collaborative process. Xiaoshi created the images of the final deliverable. Daniel and Anthony implemented the final deliverable. Daniel led the write up. <br> <strong>Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?</strong><br> Searching the dataset took 3 hours. Data cleaning took about 5 hours, and about 2 more hours during actual implementation. Deciding the visualization took 10 hours. Creating an image draft of the final deliverable took 15 hours. Coding up the final deliverable took 24 hours. Writing the write up took 3 hours. <br> </p> </footer>  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script> <script src="src.c761227b.js"></script> </body></html>
