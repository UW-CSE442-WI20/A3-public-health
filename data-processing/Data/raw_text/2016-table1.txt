—: No reported cases - The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.

* The rate is calculated using population less than 1 year  of age.

† Reportable in <25 states.

§ Total number of reported laboratory-positive dengue cases, including all confirmed cases [by anti-dengue virus (DENV) molecular diagnostic methods or seroconversion of anti-DENV IgM] and all probable cases (by a single, positive anti-DENV IgM).

¶ The rate is calculated using population less than 5 years of age.

** Chronic hepatitis B and C data are not included in NNDSS tables but reported case counts are included in the annual Summary of Viral Hepatitis, published online by CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis, available at https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2015surveillance/index.htm.

†† The rate is calculated using population less than 2 years of age.

§§ The rate is calculated using population less than 18 years of age.

¶¶ Includes Escherichia coli O157:H7; shiga toxin-positive, serogroup non-O157; and shiga toxin positive, not serogrouped.

*** Includes syphilis of all stages, including cases where stage of syphilis is not stated.

††† Data reported to ArboNET using the national surveillance case definition for congenital Zika virus disease or infection (CSTE Position Statement 16-ID-01).  Additional data reported to the US Zika Pregnancy Registry for outcomes of pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection are available at https://www.cdc.gov/zika/reporting/pregnancy-outcomes.html.  Cases reported to the US Zika Pregnancy Registry might not meet the national surveillance case definition for congenital Zika virus disease or infection.


Notes:

	These are annual cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases from the 
	National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).  
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, 
	and the U.S. territories are collated and published. 
	Cases are reported by state health departments to CDC weekly.  
	Because source datasets may be updated as additional information is received, statistics in publications 
	based on that source data may differ from what is presented in these tables. 

	The list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions for 2016 and their national 
	surveillance case definitions are available at 
	https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/notifiable/2016/infectious-diseases/, https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/notifiable/2016/infectious-diseases/.   
	This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position 
	statements approved in 2015 by CSTE for national surveillance, that were implemented in 
	January 2016, including updated surveillance case definitions for acute hepatitis C and chronic 
	hepatitis C virus infections.  2016 data are reported through June 30, 2017.  
	Publication criteria for the finalized 2016 data are available at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2016_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf, /nndss/documents/2016_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf.

	Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data. 


	Population estimates for incidence rates are July 1st, 2016 estimates
	obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
	postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for July 1, 2011 - July 1, 2016, 
	by year, county, single year of age (range: 0 to 85 years), bridged-race 
	(white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Pacific Islander), 
	Hispanic ethnicity (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino),  and sex 
	(Vintage 2016), prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau.
	Population estimates for states as of June 26, 2017 are available at 
	 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm.  
	 Population estimates for territories are the 2016 mid-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau 
	 International Data Base accessed on July 24, 2017 at 
	 https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php, https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php. 
	 The choice of population denominators for incidence is based on the availability of population 
	 data at the time of publication preparation.  

	Annual tables for 2016 and later years are available on https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/nndss_annual_tables_menu.asp, CDC WONDER.
