—: No reported cases - The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.

* The rate is calculated using population less than 1 year  of age.

† Reportable in <25 states.

§ Total number of reported laboratory-positive dengue cases, including all confirmed cases [by anti-dengue virus (DENV) molecular diagnostic methods or seroconversion of anti-DENV IgM] and all probable cases (by a single, positive anti-DENV IgM).

¶ The rate is calculated using population less than 5 years of age.

** Chronic hepatitis B and C data are not included in NNDSS tables but reported case counts are included in the annual Summary of Viral Hepatitis, published online by CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis, available at https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm.

†† The rate is calculated using population less than 2 years of age.

§§ The rate is calculated using population less than 18 years of age.

¶¶ Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease. This condition was previously named Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive disease and cases were reported to CDC using different event codes to specify whether the cases were drug resistant or in a defined age group, such as <5 years.

*** Includes Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shiga toxin-positive Escherichia coli (including O157, non-O157, and not serogrouped).

††† Data reported to ArboNET using the national surveillance case definition for congenital Zika virus disease or infection (CSTE Position Statement 16-ID-01). Additional data reported to the US Zika Pregnancy Registry for outcomes of pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection are available at https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/data/pregnancy-outcomes.html. Cases reported to the US Zika Pregnancy Registry might not meet the national surveillance case definition for congenital Zika virus disease or infection.


Notes:

	These are annual cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). 
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are 
	collated and published. Cases are reported by state health departments to CDC weekly. Because source datasets 
	may be updated as additional information is received, statistics in publications based on that source data may 
	differ from what is presented in these tables. 

	The list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions for 2017 and their national surveillance case 
	definitions are available at 
	https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/notifiable/2017/infectious-diseases/, https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/notifiable/2017/infectious-diseases/.   
	This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved in 2016 by CSTE 
	for national surveillance, that were implemented in January 2017, including updated surveillance case definitions for 
	salmonellosis, shigellosis, vibrioisis, perinatal hepatitis B virus infection, invasive pneumococcal disease, Lyme disease, 
	and tularemia reported through August 7, 2018. Publication criteria for the finalized 2017 data are available at 
	https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2017_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf, https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2017_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf.

	Population estimates for incidence rates are July 1st, 2017 estimates obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
	postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for April 1, 2010 - July 1, 2017, by year, county, single year 
	of age (range: 0 to 85 years), bridged-race (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, 
	or Pacific Islander), Hispanic ethnicity (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino), and sex (Vintage 2017), 
	prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Population estimates for states released 
	June 27, 2018 are available at 
	https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm. 
	Population estimates for territories are the 2017 mid-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base, accessed on 
	October 2, 2018 at  
	https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/informationGateway.php, https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/informationGateway.php. 
	The choice of population denominators 
	for incidence is based on the availability of population data at the time of publication preparation.
